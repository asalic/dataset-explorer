                    A public dataset that is visible (its metadata) to everyone (including users without an account) has its metadata stored as a DOI on ZENODO.

                Dataset Explorer links the various versions of a dataset between each other (so the user can navigate and find the desired version) and it also warns the user if the dataset that (s)he is viewing is not the latest version.
